        <h4>Lists</h4>
        <br>
           <ul>
            <li>ul or unordered lists are bulleted</li>
            <li>ol or ordered lists are numerical</li>
            <li>Each element in a list, ordered or unordered is notated by li</li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Process of Inserting Images</h4>
        <br>
          <ol>
            <li>Images are inserted by using the command img</li>
           <li>Images must be tied to a URL by using the command source follwed by an =</li>
            <li>The command a followed by href sends the image to a different source or webpage when clicked</li>
            <li>Alternative text can be added by using the alt command</li>
           <li>After inserting the image, adjust the height and width of the image by using width command followed by an = and height command followed by an =</li>
          </ol> 
          <br>
       <h4>Breaks</h4>
       <br>
          <ul>
           <li>A division or section can be added by using the div command</li>
           <li>A break can be added by using the br command</li>

        <h4>Tying CSS to HTML</h4>
        <br>
         <ol>
            <li>A <b>link</b> element creates the connection to the external file</li>
            <li>The <b>rel</b> attribute specifies a relationship between the current and linked document</li>
            <li>The <b>href</b> attribute specifies the location or URL of the external source. This solidifies that:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It is using a relative path</li>
                <li>This means the location is derived from the current location</li>
                <li>To locate the style sheet from the currect location we must look in the corresponding folder</li>
            </ul>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Three ways to style a webpage using CSS</h3>
      <br>
      <h4>Inline CSS: when a developer wants to style directly in the HTML file</h4>
      <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Apply to a specific HTML tag</li>
            <li>Uses a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
            <li>Useful for quick/permananent changes</li>
            <li>Less flexible than external and internal style sheets...<b>reason</b> each style must be edited individually when making a a design change</li>
            <li><b>Example:</b> using the <b>style</b> attribute to change the color of a single <b>h1</b> heading</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h4>Internal CSS Style Sheet: embedding an entire stylesheet directly into the HTML file using the style element in the head element</h4>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Contains rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML flexible</li>
            <li>The rules only apply to that particular page</li>
            <li>CSS classes and ID's can be configured to identify and style multiple elements on a page</li>
            <li>Similarly to the Inline CSS, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h4>External CSS Style Sheet: most common way to style a webpage</h4>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all CSS rules in a separate file</li>
            <li>Makes design changes easier</li>
            <li> when using, we link the file using a <b>link</b> element placed in the HTML's <b>head</b></li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h4>Separation of concerns: a widely used term in web development which refers to separating code into different files based on use and different responsibilies</h4>
        <br>
        <h3>Diagram parts of CSS rules</h3> 
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li><b>div:</b> selector, defines an element or attribute to which the rules will apply</li>
            <ul>
              <li>class attribute: a selector for a new delaration by designation</li>
              <li>allows to change specific elements but not all</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>declaration:</b> includes property and value</li>
            <li><b>declaration block:</b> where declarations live, offset by parenthesis</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3>Property Descriptions</h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>*: wild card symbol, it declares all elements on the page will have the same properties</li>
            <li>Color: adds a specific color using hex code, rgb code or generic color name</li>
            <li>Width and height: defines the space of element</li>
            <li>Margin: extra space <b>around</b> the element</li>
            <li>Auto: keeps the value to the left and right equal</li>
            <li>Border: assigns a border with a defined width and color or hex code</li>
            <li>Box-shadow: Adds shadow effects around an elements frame, descrobed by x and y offsets, relative to the element, blur, spread radius and color.</li>
            <li>Padding: adds space around the content <b>inside</b> an element</li>
            <li>text-align: aligns text right align, center, left align, uniform</li>
            <li>card: designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3>CSS box model: each box consists of margins outside the element, borders, padding, and content</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>When combining two selectors into a single CSS rule, the formatting applies to both sections.</h4>
        <br>
            <ol>
                <li>This saves on repeating the rules twice</li>
                <li>Furthermore, two or more elements which share the same style can share the same formatting</li>
                <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY): coding priniciple which encourages developers to reuse/share pieces of code in order to reduce the amount of lines in a code</li>
                <li>Helps reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase</li>
            </ol>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <br>
        <h3>Function: a set of instructions that tells the computer how to preform a task</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Different that a for loop, or conditional statement, because functions do not automatically execute when the JS file (script.js) is run</li>
          <li>Must call a function by name in order to execute</li>
          <li>This helps make the code easier to use and replicate/call as many times as needed</li>
          <li>Also allows to control where in the control flow a task is executed, or if it is at all</li>
          <li>A .CSS file is linked in the header, meanwhile a .JS is linked in the footer, but they are linked using the same method</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>2 requirements for a JS function</h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Define the function/function definition</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Used through a function declaration</li>
            <li>Function keyword, the actual word "function" is a prefix to the function declaration</li>
            <li>Code block: where the instructions for defining the function (and what it should do) lives. It is also referred to as the function body</li>
            <li><b>Console Method:</b> Steps in the code block are written through a <b>console.log</b></li>
            <li>The word console refers to the test environment that developers use to check out their code</li>
            <li>The second part .log() is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be execurtes by a computer</li>
            <li>Console.logs output a message to the web console by adding an argument located inside the parenthesis</li>
            <li>Define after the computer logs to the console</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <li>Call the function</li>
          <ul>
            <li>To call the function use the function declaration followed by a set of parenthesis and a semicolon</li>
            <li>When function is called properly, the instructions listed in the code block are executed</li>
          </ul>
          </ol>
          <br>
      <h3>Variables: a named container that allows to stores data in our code</h3>
      <br>
      <h4>Coding a Variable</h4>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Declaring a variable, the "var" keyword is used. This works for conditional statements and arrays.</li>
        <li>After the "var", give the variable a unique name. This is how it weill be referenced in our code</li>
        <li>Finally, an assignment opperator or = is used to assign the specific data that is being stored</li>
        <li> === is a strict equality operator which checks to see if two values are equal and returns to the Boolean result of true or false if the values are not equal</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
        <h3>Arrays: stores a group of related data in a variable and uses a for loop to preform a task on each piece of data, while only using a few lines of code.</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>Coding an Array</h4>
        <br>
        <ol>
        <li>In order to use an array with a single piece of data, the location of the data item within the array is neccessary. This location is identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
        <li>To access an individual index, start with the name of the array, then a pair of square brackets and inside is the number of the index, to see the array in action it is put in the console.log function</li>
        <li>To preform a for loop a conditional statement like an if or else statement has to be used as well</li>
        <li>The second half needed for a for loop is the array's length. This determines the amount of times the for loop is repeated until there are no items left in the array.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3>Three statements in a for loop</h3></li>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Starting point of a for loop: declare the variable (x) and give it a value of 0 (all first indices begin with 0)</li>
          <li>Conditon of a for loop: as long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will continue running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each array. To do this, we use the <b>.length</b> property within our array.</li>
          <li>The final statement: allows the array to reiterate over each item. To show the increse of the indices by 1, use the shortcut x++. This allows the code to loop while increasing by 1, without having to type all the console.logs</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3>Terms</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Control Flow:</b> is the order in which a computer executes in a script, which runs from the first statement at the top down to the bottom of the page. Can be useful by using conditional statements and loops</li>
        <li><b>Conditional Statements:</b> allows programs to follow written instructions based on the variables</li>
        <li><b>If statements:</b> checks whether or not a condition is true or false</li>
        <li><b>Truthy:</b> If condition is true. If a conditional statement is truthy it will follow the action we asked it to do in between curly brackets. If it is not truthy, or considered falsy, then the computer will ignore the conditional statement between the brackets.</li>
        <li><b>Falsy:</b> it will be denoted as 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type of false.</li>
        <li><b>Else if:</b> a different conditional statement that can be used if the second contion is truthy</li>
        <li><b>Loops:</b> allow for indices to be stated without having to list them all within a console log</li>
        <li><b>Index:</b> Each piece of a data's location number can access the individual data inside the array. JavaScript and many other programming languages have a 0 index and are sequencial following the 0. Meaning the data index will begin with the number 0, then 1, 2, 3...</li>
        <li><b>for loops:</b> uses predictable pattern of indices to preform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
        <li><b>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (API's):</b> provide functionality such as: dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples</li>
        <li><b>Third-party API's:</b> allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook</li>
        <li><b>Third-party frameworks and libraries:</b> can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Background Information</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Commenting out:</b> used by denoting /*, this allows the code to remain without being seen or actively used</li>
        <li><b>Strings:</b> include all the topics contained in quotation marks, followed by a semicolon</li>
        <li><b>Function Example:</b> stacking dishes, fancy plates on top shelf, regular plates on bottom shelf...else if its a bowl, stack ontop regular plates on bottom shelf</li>
        <li>A computer will finish all conditonal statements listed, evaluating if it is truth or falsy</li>
        <li><b>For loop example broken down: </b>for(var x=0; x < shapes.length; x++) {console.log(shapes[x]);}</li>
